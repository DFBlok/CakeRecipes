                <p><b>Tip from recipe creator safinabakes1231:</b> “For a healthier version, use 1 1/2 <br>
                    tablespoons of plain unsweetened applesauce instead of canola oil, and use 3 <br>
                    tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon of water instead of milk.”</p>

                    together and I added some salted caramel chips on top. It was great. Super <br>
                    moist and chocolaty.”

                    “Every mug cake I’ve ever tried came out gross and rubbery except this one,”<br>
                     says another community member. “The cake is sooo good! I put mini chocolate<br>
                      chips in it and ice cream on top when it was done. I’ve made this cake every day<br>
                       for the past week. I’m addicted!!!”

                    community member. “PLUS: a bit of peanut butter mixed in is nice on occasion. I <br>
                    also like some raisins in it, for variety, OR peanut butter chips!”
